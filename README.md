A sample playback object for the Teensy Audio Library which improves upon the built-in AudioPlayMemory object by adding an easy to use and musically useful pitch shifting function which works with semitones on the chromatic scale.

This object currently only supports sample arrays created with [wav2sketch](http://crudlabs.org/wav2sketch/) using 16 bit PCM encoding and a 44100 sample rate!
